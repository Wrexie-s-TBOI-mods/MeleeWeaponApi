# Melee Weapon API

***A user-friendly way of implementing melee weapons in mods for The Binding of Isaac: Repentance.***

To use to API, with the mod installed and enabled, an global class serving as namespace is exposed: `MeleeWeaponApi`.
Inside this class you will find a function: `.Create(options)`, to create instances of `EntityMelee`.

The `EntityMelee` class is a subclass of `EntityEffect`, which means that you must provide it with the `EntityVariant` id of an *effect*, but it also means that you can you can use all properties and methods of `EntityEffect` and `Entity` as well!

`EntityMelee` is designed around calling specialised callbacks on various actions and states.
These callbacks are all functions with a name starting with `:On...` and that you can override with your own code, leaving to the API most of the worries of managing game/weapon/player state and all the `AddCallback` logic.
You still have easy access to your weapon's state, and, if you really want to, you can modify it, though I don't particularly recommend it.
When one such callback is run during the execution of a `ModCallback`, the corresponding `ModCallback` is mentioned in its documentation and in-editor annotations under `[Parent callback]`.

`MeleeWeaponApi` also contains an `Util` class, serving as a namespace for a whole bunch of neat little functions designed to make code more readable while also reducing boilerplate.

To access all the types and in-editor documentation, it is recommended to download the `Types`, and copy it anywhere into your mod's folder under any name you like, e.g. `path/to/game/mods/My AWESOME mod/MWA types`. A Virtual Studio Code extension *might* come in the future to rid the need for this step.

Full documentation and examples comming *soon:tm:*.

Requirements:

- Afterbirth+ and Repentance
- Repentogon

## FAQ*

> **What did you use to make this ?**  
> VS Code and the Binding of Isaac extension, StyLua for formatting and Selene for code linting.  
> Docs are generated from the typings in `Types` using LDoc.  
<!--  -->
> **Can I use it for my mod ?**  
> Of course, that's what it's made for !  
> Just make sure to mention the API somewhere in the mod's description, I'd love for more people to find it. ðŸ˜Š  
<!--  -->
> **Can I help you develop the API ?**  
> Sure, if you find any bugs or if you have some feature/improvement proposal, you're welcome to open a PR and I will gladly take a look at it !  
<!--  -->
> **What was your motivation to make this ?**  
> Well, I wanted to make my first mod a character with a melee weapon. I tried using things from the game like `EntityKnife` but didn't get anything good.  
> So I looked and asked on Discord for any kind of existing API to make weapons easily and my search yielded no results.  
> Why not just make that my first mod, and then use it in my second mod, you know ?

> **Hey, just wondering if you got your photos printed?**

*Nobody asked anything about this API so I faked some "interesting" questions.
